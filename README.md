Yo I'm insanely autisi- I mean insanely stu- I mean a Programmer.
Boring stuf:
1. I have 3 GitHub accounts, good luck.
2. I know F# and C#, don't ask me about Python.
3. I exist.

I also manage 2 teams, we got PEM [Project Emerald Mountain](https://project-emerald-mountain.vercel.app), we got rednaZ, pretty boring.

These are PEM files, get them [here](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m23c8n5qhgou6/PEM.dev), I know it's the same, I couldn't care less.
